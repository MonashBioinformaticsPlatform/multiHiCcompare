Description: HiCcompare2 provides functions for joint normalization and difference detection in multiple Hi-C datasets. This extension of
    the original HiCcompare package now allows for Hi-C experiments with more than 2 groups and multiple samples per group. HiCcompare2 
    operates on processed Hi-C data in the form of sparse upper triangular matrices. It accepts four column (chromosome, region1, region2, IF)
    tab-separated text files storing chromatin interaction matrices. HiCcompare2 provides cyclic loess and fast loess (fastlo) methods adapted
    to jointly normalizing Hi-C data. Additionally, it provides a general linear model (GLM) framework adapting the edgeR package to detect
    differences in Hi-C data in a distance dependent manner.
